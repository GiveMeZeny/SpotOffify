SpotOffify
==========
A tiny ad blocker for Spotify (tested on Win7 x64 with Spotify v1.0.25.127.g58007b4c) on Windows that simply mutes all ads by hooking an internal function (I've used [buFFy!'s _SpotOffify_](http://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/coding-releases/2728234-spotoffify-silence-all-them-adz.html) before, which does the same thing but is outdated by now, and as I got used to the name I stole it, I hope it's k).

## Installation

Compile [XmlLite.asm](src/XmlLite.asm) with [FASM](http://flatassembler.net/) and invoke [install.bat](install.bat).
