SpotOffify
==========

A small ad-blocker for Spotify on Windows that simply mutes the ads by reading and hooking some internal variable and function (I've used [buFFy!'s _SpotOffify_](http://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/coding-releases/2728234-spotoffify-silence-all-them-adz.html) before, which does the same thing but is outdated by now, and as I got used to the name I stole it, I hope it's k).

## Installation

Compile [d3d9.asm](src/d3d9.asm) with [FASM](http://flatassembler.net/) and invoke [install.bat](install.bat).

## License
